## Dataset Overview
SEE-V2X is a cross-layer dataset, which includes the application layer network traces generated by the C-V2X radio, C-V2X MAC layer trace and Sidelink control information captured by USRP B210. 

The dataset includes 4 scenarios in total:
- Indoor allcombos
  - Include all the possible comniations of parameters as shown in the figure below. 
  The data collection period for each test is around 30 seconds.

- Indoor special
  - We pick certain representative configurations and extend the data collection duration to 1 hour.

   <!-- The selected configurations are shown in the table below. -->

- Outdoor parkinglot
  - We pick 10 representative cases and collect data in a parking lot. The configurations are This scneario doesn't have GNSS coordinations.

- Outdoor intersection
  - We pick 10 presentative cases and collect data in a busy intersection. This test has GNSS coordinations generated by a high-end IMU, xsens.

For the details of these configurations, please refer to the paper for more details.

```
The logs in different scenarios are stored in the corresponding folders. The logs are stored in CSV format. All scenarios include the following files:
- tx_[UE].csv
- rx_[UE1]\_tx\_[UE2]\_[Application].csv
- mac.csv
- sci.csv

For the outdoor intersection scenario, the GNSS data is also included and stored in the GNSS folder. The GNSS coordinates are collected by a high-end IMU, xsens and the sampling rate is 100 Hz.

Besides, there will a parameters.csv file in the outdoor scenarios, which includes the parameters used in each test.

### tx_[UE].csv
This file is the application layer trace of the transmitter, which is generated by the C-V2X radio. The log includes the following fields:
- equipment_id: The identity of the transmitter.
- seq_num: The transmitting packet sequence number.
- priority: The transmitting packet priority, which affects the C-V2X radio transmitting behavior.
- timestamp: The transmitting packet timestamp.
- channel_busy_percentage: The channel busy percentage reported by the C-V2X radio.

### rx_[UE1]\_tx\_[UE2]\_[Application].csv
This is the end-to-end, receiver side application layer trace. The log is generated by UE1 and includes the E2E performance of UE2->UE1.
- rx_timestamp (us): The timestamp when the packet is received.
- latency (ms): Latency = rx_timestamp - tx_timestamp
- per_ue_loss_pct (%): The packet loss rate for different UEs.
- ipg (ms): The inner packet gap (jitter).
- tx_equipment_id: The identity of the transmitter.
- tx_seq_num: The sequence number of the transmitter.
- tx_priority: The transmitted packet priority.

### mac.csv
This is the C-V2X MAC layer trace captured by the USRP B210. 
MAC layer handles the radio resource management, scheduling, and the data link layer functions.
In C-V2X, there are additional source layer-2 IDs and destination layer-2 IDs in the MAC layer header to identify the transmitter and receiver.

### sci.csv
This is the sidelink control information captured by the USRP B210. SCI is an important information used in C-V2X to schedule the sidelink resources automatically between the UEs. The data in SCI.csv includes 
- **timestamp**: The timestamp in us when the USRP captures the SCI packet over the air. 
- priority: Determines the max tolerated latency for the packet.
- resource_resv: The resource reservation period in the SPS scheudling.
- freq_resourece: The frequency resource used by the packet.
- time_gap: The time gap between the initial transmission and the retransmission.
- mcs_idx: The modulation and coding scheme index.
- retransmission: Indicates whether the packet is a retransmission.
- transmission_format: Indicates the SCI format.
- **sf_idx**: The subframe index.
- **pssch_start**: The starting position of the PSCCH 
- **nof_prb_pssch**: The number of PRBs used by the packet.
- **N_x_id**: The code used to do scrambling.

The bold fields are not included in the original SCI packet, they are added for analysis convinence. For more details about each field in SCI, please refer to the 3GPP TS 36.212.

## Example usage
In the scripts folder, we provide some basic utils to compute network metrics and visualize the data (e.g., channel occupy status, packet loss rate, etc.).
The example usage is provided in the ```showResults.ipynb``` . For the channel occupy status, the figure is interactive, you can drag or zoom in/out.

All scripts are tested on Ubuntu 22.04:
- Python 3.13.0
  - jupyter 1.1.1
  - numpy 2.1.2
  - pandas 2.2.3
  - matplotlib 3.9.2
  - bokeh 3.6.0
